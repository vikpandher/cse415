Questions - How does Q-Learning work with dynamic state spaces?
	  - Multiple moves in one turn? -- possible
	  - 

Game Master - handle the turn taking

Q-learning - how? 
	   - important when things die
	   - satic eval function?
	   - 

State Space Search - Iterative deeping and heuristic

Moves - Take a step, take a step and drop bomb, do not move

States - board w/ current pieces, players & bombs & walls, bombs have a timer

Operator - preconditions: check can move, check can place bomb; transition: move & bomb/no bomb

Can move - have space, dont move into bomb zone or wall or other player

Can place bomb - one at a time or wait two turns or some restriction

End State - Kill the other player

Heuristic - trap other player

Values - Living Value: -.1 (dependant on position), Breaking Wall: +1, Killing Other Player: +10, Dieing: -10

Changes - Board Walls move in over time -> better to be in center of board

Moving - Manhattan movement

Interactive - take user input -> stretch feature
	    - could add random other enemies that simply use Q-Learning
	    - could add power ups or additional features
