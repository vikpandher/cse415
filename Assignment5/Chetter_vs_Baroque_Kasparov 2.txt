The Gamemaster says, "Players, introduce yourselves."
     (Playing WHITE:) My name is Chetter Hummin, but you can call me Master.  I
come to take over Earth and beat everyone in Chess. I was
programmed by Chloe Nash and Vik Pandher.  If you have a
problem with my hostile takeover you can contact them at
chloen2 or vik10.
Bring it on.
     (Playing BLACK:) Hello. I am Baroque_Kasparov_BC_Player, created by Stephen
 Hills (sahills) and Tyler Williamson (williaty). Good luck!
