Retrospective:
Chloe Nash - worked on the initialization and set up of the state structure and puzzle structure. Learned about creating objects and the struggles of developing puzzles. There are a LOT of states to consider.

Vik Pandher - wrote the heuristic functions and play mehtods. 

Both- worked to develop and implement all methods and also debug.
